# Project Description

This is a simple project showing how to implement some XAML controls:

* Label
* Combobox
* Datagrid

The code is as simple as possible, however, 
perhaps things can be done even easier.

Binding is not yet two-way.

The Combobox selection is shown with Debug output.
