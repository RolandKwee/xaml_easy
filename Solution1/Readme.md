# Solution Description

This solution is a collection of projects,
each with a standalone WPF app,
demonstrating one control.

Currently, there is only one project.
The idea is that more is coming.

The reason to start this effort is that I had to work 
on WPF XAML apps and that this turned out to be really complex.
I found many tutorials and examples, but those showed really nice
solutions with MVVM technology and lots of fancy classes.
I needed to learn just how to implement controls in XAML.
I found out that lots of code in other solutions 
was not strictly needed.
Here, I left out as much as possible to drill down to the absolute necessity.
